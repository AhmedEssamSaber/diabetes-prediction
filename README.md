# 🏥 Diabetes Prediction Web App  

A machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on patient details. This project uses Streamlit for deployment and integrates a trained machine learning model to provide accurate predictions.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive UI built with Streamlit.  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Predicts diabetes using factors such as age, BMI, blood glucose level, and medical history.  
- **Categorical Feature Encoding**: Handles gender, smoking history, hypertension, and heart disease.  
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays results with success/error messages and related images.  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `Project_Deployment.py` - Streamlit-based application for user input and model prediction.  
- `Diabetes.sav` - Pre-trained machine learning model.  
- `Diabetes project notebook.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for training and evaluation.  

## 🛠 How to Run  
1. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
